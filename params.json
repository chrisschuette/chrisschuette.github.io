{"name":"Chrisschuette.github.io","tagline":"","body":"About\r\n=====\r\n\r\nI am a quantum physicist with a PhD and a Master's degree in theoretical physics from the University of Cologne, Germany, 5+ years of scientific programming experience (C/C++) and a passion for game development.\r\n\r\nProgramming has always fascinated me and I have been writing code since I was in high-school. In my diploma thesis at the Max Planck Institute for Neurological Researh I applied ideas from information theory to unsupervised learning problems in neuroinformatics. Subsequently I moved to strongly correlated electron systems (condensed matter physics) and developed HPC applications for the numerical solution of quantum systems.\r\n\r\nMy passion for game development started early on. In 1999 I wrote my first 3D graphics engine with a friend in high school (3dfx's Glide API - yes, those were the dark days of vendor-specific 3D API's) and ever since then have been involved in various personal game development projects. As of late I have been mainly interested in physics integration in games and sketched a game development library (Hephaestus), including two exemplary mini-games ('SuperAsteroids' and 'Night & Day').\r\n\r\nEducation\r\n=========\r\n- Dr. rer. nat.
